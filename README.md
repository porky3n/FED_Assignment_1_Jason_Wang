**Design Process**
Our design rationale is to create a user-friendly website that caters to bowlers of all skill levels. Whether you're seeking professional coaching or looking to purchase new bowling equipment, our website is designed to provide you with a seamless and informative experience.

1. **New Bowlers**: If you're new to bowling and looking for your first coaching session, we recommend starting with our "About Us" page.
