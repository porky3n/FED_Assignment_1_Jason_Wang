Our design rationale is to create a user-friendly website that caters to bowlers of all skill levels. Whether you're seeking professional coaching or looking to purchase new bowling equipment, our website is designed to provide you with a seamless and informative experience.

1. **New Bowlers**: If you're new to bowling and looking for your first coaching session, we recommend starting with our "About Us" page. Here, you can learn about our background, rationale and the expertise of our team. Once you're familiar with our background, you can explore the "Coaching Page" for detailed information about our coaching levels and what each session entails.

2. **Experienced Bowlers**: If you're an experienced bowler seeking additional training during the competition period, our "Coaching Page" is your go-to resource. Here, you can find information about private training sessions designed to refine your game and enhance your performance.

3. **Equipment Needs**: For bowlers of all levels looking to purchase new bowling balls or maintain their current ones, our "Equipment Page" is a must-visit.
